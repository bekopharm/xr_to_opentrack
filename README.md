# About

This is a proof-of-concept reading IMU data from xr_driver
e.g. for Viture Pro glasses on Linux PC. This data is
provided via IPC shared memory by Breezy Desktop and
forwarded via UDP to OpenTrack (or directly to a game that
features head tracking via UDP).

Looking for a Rust implementation? See https://github.com/hodasemi/xr_to_opentrack_rs ðŸ‘Œ

# Start

Run with `php xr_to_opentrack_poc.php`
